# square_wave_generation assembly language
Initialize the Tmod register with count 1 in mode 2 and timer 0 in mode 1
Firstly start the counter 1 and keep incrementing A value . keep storing the counted value in any port for example p2.
Check the counted value and make sure that it doesnâ€™t cross 10.
Once it reaches 10 then stop the counter 1 and start the timer.
Put TL0 value as 33H from the below calculations.
Wait till tf0 becomes 1. If it becomes 1 then it means that we waited for 0.5
msec
Then stop the timer and go back and compliment the p1.2 value and
continue the process.
